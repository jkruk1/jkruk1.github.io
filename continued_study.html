<h3>Khan Academy</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/jkruk1/">https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/jkruk1/</a></p>
<p>A website with a massive collection of online courses covering all manner of mathematics, science, and the humanities. Good mixture of video lectures and other exercises.<p>

<h3>Duolingo</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/profile/JamesKruk">https://www.duolingo.com/profile/JamesKruk</a></p>
<p>Popular app for learning languages. Very clean UI, with aggressive gamifications and reminders to keep you engaged. Sub-optimal for actually <i>learning</i> the rules of grammar, however.</p>

<h3>Udemy</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/james-kruk/">https://www.udemy.com/user/james-kruk/</a></p>
<p>Online courses, overwhelmingly self-paced lecture format. Provides a certificate upon completion, which is nice, though the quality of the courses varies <i>massively</i>. Prices also fluctuate wildly, and if you wait a few weeks there is almost certain to be a sale of some sort.</p>

<h3>Cengage Learning </h3>
<p><a href="https://education.gale.com/l-tplmain/SearchResults.aspx">https://education.gale.com/l-tplmain/SearchResults.aspx</a></p>
<p>Online classes available through the Toronto Public Library. Varying quality.</p>
